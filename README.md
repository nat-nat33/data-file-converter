## Project Description
The purpose of this project was to read in a `csv` file that contained bootcamp graduate data and convert the data in that file into `json` and `xml` formats.

### Tools Used
- python
- python libs csv and json
- vs code

### Key Findings
- Reporting data for technical bootcamps has only been reported since 16. So being that it is fairly new and unstructured it was hard to find consistent data.
- Most data that had been reported by bootcamps was in `pdf` forms online reported by [CIRR](https://cirr.org/data).
