## Project Description
The purpose of this project was to read in a `csv` file that contained bootcamp graduate data and convert the data in that file into `json` and `xml` formats.

### Tools Used
- python
- python libs csv, json, pandas
- vs code

### Data
- csv clean file ()
- json formatted file ()
- xml formatted file ()

### Key Findings
- Reporting data for technical bootcamps has only been reported since 16. So being that it is fairly new and unstructured it was hard to find consistent data.
- Most data that had been reported by bootcamps was in `pdf` forms online reported by [CIRR](https://cirr.org/data). 

### Methods
#### Phase 1:
- Since the data was in pdfs, I had to convert the file to csv using an online converter and downloading the csv file.
- After looking at the data, I realized it was unstructured.
- I had to consolidate the data from the schools into one file. Since the data was inconsistant, I had to do some manual cleansing to ensure data integrity.
- A cleaned data file
